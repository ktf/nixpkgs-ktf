# My own personal overlay

This is my personal set of customization to the current nixpkgs distribution.

I use this to setup my own preferred choice of packages, mixing python versions
and keeping bleeding edge.

However, anything which you can see here is based on the master nixpkgs. No
uncommitted packages at this point.
